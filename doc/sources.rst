Data Sources

This chapter describes details of metric data sources.

************************
Pre-Defined Data Sources
************************

``const``
=========

Specifies a constant to be used as a metric value. This source is useful for metrics that need to be entered manually, but also rarely change.

JSON config fields for metrics using source ``const``:

* ``"source": "const"``
* ``"value"`` (required): floating-point value between 0 and 1 to be used as the metric value.

``customsearch``
================

Captures search engine optimization efficiency with Google search. It looks at the top ``N`` results with certain search phrase and calculates the metric value as following:

* ``0`` if the target web page is not found in the top ``N`` results.
* ``(N+1-n) / N`` if the target web page is found as n\ :sup:`th` result. It is easy to see that this equals to ``1`` if the target page is the first search result and then linearly decreases until it becomes ``0``.

JSON config fields for metrics using source ``customsearch``:

* ``"source": "customsearch"``
* ``"URL"`` (required): target web page.
* ``"num"`` (optional, defaults to ``50``): number of search results to consider.

Since this source accesses Google services, authentication details need to be provided using ``--auth`` command line option. Authentication JSON file needs to have the following entry::

    "Google": {
        "custom search API key": "API key goes here",
        "search engine ID": "search engine ID goes here"
    }

See `here <https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview>`_ for information about Google API key and search engine ID.

See `here <https://github.com/lunarserge/facere-sensum/tree/main/examples/config_customsearch.json>`_ for an example of using the ``customsearch`` data source.

``user``
========

Prompts a user to enter the value manually. This source is useful for metrics that can not be automatically computed.

JSON config fields for metrics using source ``user``:

* ``"source": "user"``

Source ``user`` does not use any additional fields.
